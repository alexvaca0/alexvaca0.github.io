I'm Alejandro Vaca, 22yo, from Madrid (Spain). I'm currently engaged in a Master's Degree Program in Data Science & Big Data. Previously, I was graduated in Business. I'm also a piano player, love sports and I'm an amateur writer. This last hobby, together with my passion for Data Science & Machine Learning, were the ones that impulsed me to create this blog. By writing these pages I intend for others to embrace data as I do, it is directed towards curious minds that want to learn more about different aspects of the world through data. It can tell us much of who we are, how the economy works, and much more. So I invite you to explore this magic reality of us with the use of these new techniques that are launching Artificial Intelligence to the sky.
